# R4Econ

Shared resources for Econ Research Assistants and any other Econs working in R. 

## To ask a question

1.  Create an issue
2.  Clearly title with your question
3.  Clearly describe what you need to know and provide as much context or even code as needed

## To contribute to R4Econ

1. Read our contributing guidelines (includes resources on how to do the following in GitHub)
2.  Fork this repository / Create a new branch
3.  Make edits in the new fork / branch
4.  Create a pull request to add edits to the master branch with a clear description of changes or additions
5.  Hannah (kinda admin right now) will then merge your pull request with the master. In future, you can probably just merge your own pull request after carefully examining any conflicts. (The magic of version control!)
